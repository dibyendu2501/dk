**Feedback**

Approach to provide assignments to evaluate candidates is really appreciated. I truly believe 2-3 hours of in campus tests are not always best way to evaluate candidates for recruitment. So thanks a lot to do this.

For assignment #1 credit card expiry date is already passed. So Successful transaction of buying pillow was not possible. But code was tested till end by changing expiry value as '07/20'.

For assignment #2 only string compare was done.
